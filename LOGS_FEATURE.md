# Analysis Logs Feature

## Overview

The Adaptive Threat Modeler now includes a comprehensive logs viewing feature that allows users to view detailed analysis logs in an elegant and intuitive UI.

## How It Works

### 1. Analysis Completion
When a GitHub repository or ZIP file analysis completes, users will see:
- A success message showing the number of vulnerabilities found
- A **"View Logs"** button that redirects to the logs page

### 2. Logs Page Features
The logs page (`/logs/{analysisId}`) includes:

#### **Same Layout & Design**
- Navigation bar
- 3D brain animation background
- Particle effects
- Same color scheme and glassmorphism design

#### **Logs Display**
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Different log types are color-coded:
  - ðŸ”´ **Critical vulnerabilities** - Red
  - ðŸŸ  **High severity** - Orange  
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium severity** - Yellow
  - ðŸ”µ **Low severity** - Blue
  - ðŸŸ¢ **File analysis progress** - Green
  - ðŸ”µ **Analysis metadata** - Cyan
  - ðŸŸ£ **Risk scores & summaries** - Purple
  - âšª **Section headers** - Primary color with glow

#### **Interactive Features**
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy all logs with one click
- **Download Logs**: Download logs as a text file
- **Scrollable View**: Logs are contained in a scrollable area
- **Monospace Font**: Easy-to-read formatting

### 3. Sample Log Output

The logs include detailed information such as:

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
- **Log Capture**: Modified `analyzer.go` to capture all analysis output to a buffer
- **Log Storage**: Added in-memory storage for logs (can be replaced with database)
- **API Endpoint**: Added `/api/v1/analysis/{id}/logs` endpoint
- **Handler**: Created `GetAnalysisLogs` handler

### Frontend Changes
- **New Page**: Created `LogsPage.tsx` with full layout
- **Routing**: Added `/logs/:analysisId` route
- **API Integration**: Added `getAnalysisLogs` method to API service
- **UI Enhancement**: Added "View Logs" button to success message

## User Experience

1. **Start Analysis**: User enters GitHub URL or uploads ZIP file
2. **Wait for Completion**: Progress is shown during analysis
3. **View Results**: Success message appears with vulnerability count
4. **Access Logs**: Click "View Logs" button to see detailed analysis logs
5. **Interact with Logs**: Copy, download, or scroll through the formatted logs
6. **Return Home**: Easy navigation back to the main page

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what was analyzed
- **Debugging**: Developers can understand analysis results better
- **Documentation**: Logs can be saved for compliance or reporting
- **Trust**: Detailed logs build confidence in the analysis process
- **Accessibility**: Even naive users can understand the color-coded output

The logs feature provides complete visibility into the analysis process while maintaining the elegant, user-friendly design of the application.
