# Test File for Detailed Git Diff Analysis

This is a test file to demonstrate detailed git diff analysis.

## Features
- Shows exact content changes
- Line-by-line differences  
- Addition and deletion tracking

Let's add some code:

```go

    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    return "success"
}
```

This will show up as added content in the git diff.

## Additional Content
- This line will be tracked as an addition
- Each line change will be visible
