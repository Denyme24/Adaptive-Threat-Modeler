# Test File for Detailed Git Diff Analysis

This is a test file to demonstrate detailed git diff analysis.

## Features
- Shows exact content changes
- Line-by-line differences  
- Addition and deletion tracking
- File status information

Let's add some code:

```go
func ExampleFunction() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    fmt.Println("This is a modified line!")
    return "success"
}

func NewFunction() {
    log.Println("This is a new function added!")
    return nil
}
```

This will show up as added content in the git diff.

## Additional Content
- This line will be tracked as an addition
- Each line change will be visible
- The diff will show context around changes

Testing complete!

## Update Log
- Added new function to demonstrate code additions
- Modified existing function to show line changes
- This section was added to show content modifications
